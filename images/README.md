# Portfolio-2022
This is for my portfolio, and to see how much I work the following months! âœ¨

Friday 30 Sep:
- 22:36 Having trouble connecting github with a local website.
- 23:30 found out that everything I coded was not in the github folder, so I copied everything and pasted it in the right folder.

Saturday 1 Oct:
- 00:15 Added a .htacess because the other one I had was suddenly gone.

- 00:20 Got dictionary.json to work!
#PROBLEM: 
Couldn't understand why it didn't work when I typed <?php= $data['en_title'] ?>
but when i changed it to <?= $data['en_title'] ?> it would show my dictionary with the "Welcome!" ... Try and search it up Monica you idiot!

- 00:27 UPDATE ON WHAT THE DIFFERENCE IS
#THE ANSWER:
To understand it this is what it means:

<?= is not the same as <?php

<?= is the same as <?php echo

<? is the same as <?php

Which makes a lot more sense, remember to write it down in your notes dummy.
