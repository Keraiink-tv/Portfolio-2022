# Portfolio-2022
This is for my portfolio, and to see how much I work the following months! âœ¨

Friday 30 Sep:
- 22:36 Having trouble connecting github with a local website.
- 23:30 found out that everything I coded was not in the github folder, so I copied everything and pasted it in the right folder.
